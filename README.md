# MBE3 Heating Stage Controller (Notebook Version)

This repo contains a single, self-contained notebook **`auto_mbe3_control.ipynb`** that
(1) runs the instrument control (sanitized demo), (2) logs results to CSV, and
(3) generates plots for **Current/Voltage/Temperature vs Time**.

> ⚠️ Production addresses/limits are not included. Keep real device configs in a private `config.local.yaml` (git-ignored).
